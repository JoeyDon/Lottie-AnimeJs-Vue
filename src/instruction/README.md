# Clemenger BBDO - FE Developer Test


## The Brief

Using the attached design file `design.sketch` as a reference, build and integrate the UI in a responsive way, considering necessary animations and transitions.


## Rules

- Must be supported in Chrome browser.
- Must use at least the following stack: Sass / Html5 / JavaScript.
- Need to be built responsive and adapt correctly on different mobile and tablet breakpoints (desktop version not required).
- The design header is an animation that can be integrated using [Lottie](https://airbnb.design/lottie/) library. The reference animation file is `animation.json` and can be previewed via [https://lottiefiles.com/preview](https://lottiefiles.com/preview).
- "First walk" and "Walk bonus" scoring bars should fill up in an animated way after the page is entirely loaded. Animation can be similar to what you can find as scoring animation when playing RPG games.


## Deliverables

- ZIP package file containing all necessary files, code source, and instructions on how to run locally.


## Tips

- Can be built using the Vue.js framework, or a custom Gulp file.
- Download [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) to be able to open the source design file attached. Alternatively, it is also possible to use [Figma](https://www.figma.com).
- Animations and transition shouldn't be too crazy. We are looking for something elegant that demonstrate an eye for design and timings.
- Points and dollar value part of the design are used as examples. You're free to use different values if you prefer.
- Use Google Fonts. If one of the font families is not available on Google Fonts, please replace by the closest font you can find.


## Bonus

- Bonus points for considering accessibility, assets optimisation, and performances.
